# AI Tools in Computer Science Academic Tasks: Usage Patterns & Implications  
## Subtitle: A Survey of CUHKSZ Students (2025)  
**Speaker**: [Your Name] | **Date**: Dec 2025  


### 1. Introduction: The AI-Driven Shift in Academic Tasks (30s)  
- **Scenario Opener**:  
  "Imagine tomorrow is the homework deadline, and you haven’t started—what would you do? Today, many CS students might open AI tools like ChatGPT or Wenxin Yiyan…"  
- **Research Background**:  
  - AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) have deeply penetrated academic workflows.  
  - Existing studies focus on technical capabilities but lack analysis of students’ actual usage behaviors.  
- **Research Significance**:  
  Reveal CS students’ AI usage status to inform educational optimization and tool design.  


### 2. Methodology: Data Source & Core Questions (30s)  
- **Data Collection**:  
  - Online survey via Wenjuanxing (11 valid responses, covering all undergraduate years).  
  - Survey dimensions: Usage frequency, task types, tool preferences, accuracy perception, dependency, etc.  
- **Core Research Questions**:  
  1. How do students use AI tools? (Frequency, scenarios, tool choices)  
  2. What impact does AI have on learning outcomes and academic integrity?  
  3. What challenges exist, and how to address them?  


### 3. Key Findings: The Data Behind AI Usage (2 mins)  

#### 3.1 High-Frequency Usage is Norm  
- **Data**: 90.91% of students use AI frequently ("often": 72.73%; "daily": 18.18%); only 9.09% never use it.  
- **Implication**: AI has become a "standard academic tool," but barriers for non-users require investigation.  


#### 3.2 Task Preferences: Writing & Knowledge Acquisition  
- **Data**: Report writing (72.73%) and learning new knowledge (72.73%) dominate; code debugging (36.36%) and algorithm design (27.27%) lag.  
- **Gap**: AI is overused for basic tasks but underutilized for complex logical tasks (e.g., debugging).  


#### 3.3 Tool Preference: Domestic Models Lead  
- **Data**: Domestic models (e.g., Wenxin Yiyan) dominate (72.73%), far exceeding ChatGPT (54.55%), GitHub Copilot (9.09%).  
- **Possible Reasons**: Accessibility, language adaptability, or policy influence.  


#### 3.4 Risks & Challenges: Dependency & Accuracy Concerns  
- **Top Worries**: Plagiarism risk (72.73%), over-reliance (63.64%), content accuracy (72.73%).  
- **Behavioral Insight**: 72.7% of students "fully/partially verify" AI outputs, yet 63.64% fear "ability degradation."  


### 4. Key Implications & Recommendations (1 min)  

#### 4.1 For Educators  
- **Curriculum Design**: Reduce mechanical tasks (e.g., templated reports); increase open-ended questions to lower "forced dependency" motives.  
- **Academic Integrity**: Clarify AI usage boundaries (e.g., labeling AI contribution ratio); host "AI Ethics" workshops.  


#### 4.2 For Tool Developers  
- **Function Optimization**: Strengthen support for code debugging and algorithm design (fill current capability gaps).  
- **Transparency Features**: Add error probability prompts and citation tracing to alleviate accuracy anxiety.  


#### 4.3 For Students  
- **Usage Strategy**: For complex problems, "think independently first, then use AI for verification" (aligning with 63.63% of students’ preferences).  
- **Balance**: Position AI as a "thinking assistant" rather than a substitute.  


### 5. Conclusion: Balancing Efficiency & Growth (30s)  
- **Summary**: AI is an "efficiency accelerator," but over-reliance may cause "ability hollowing."  
- **Call to Action**: Collaborate across educators, developers, and students to build an "AI-assisted autonomous learning" ecosystem.  
- **Future Work**: Expand sample size to explore long-term impacts of AI on learning outcomes.
